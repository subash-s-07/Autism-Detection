# Autism Detection Web App

This web application, built using Streamlit, aims to detect autism using various machine learning models like Logistic Regression, SVM, XGBoost, and different algorithms. The UI is neatly enhanced with explanations provided by LIME (Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations), and data visualizations are presented using Plotly.

The demo video is given : /screenshots/demo.mp4
## Features:

- **Multiple Models:** Logistic Regression, SVM, XGBoost, and more.
- **LIME Explanations:** Understand model predictions through LIME.
- **Interactive Plots:** Visualize data using Plotly.

## Technologies Used:

- **Streamlit:** Fast and easy creation of web apps.
- **Plotly:** Interactive plotting library.
- **Scikit-learn:** Machine learning models.
- **LIME:** Explaining predictions of machine learning models.
